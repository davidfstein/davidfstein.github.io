                    <p>As a highly motivated student at Northeastern University, my interest in biomimicry 
                        and software design drove me to pursue a Bachelors of Science degree in Computer 
                        Science and Biology. My strengths include, responsive thinking, and fast-paced, 
                        real-time problem solving skills. I find that my abilities in these areas are 
                        helpful when searching for coding solutions. I aspire to use my knowledge of 
                        CS and Biology to help develop novel biological technologies.
